                        The church is a twin-spired neo-gothic structure. It is believed that the church was modeled after the Cathedral of St. Peter in Montpellier, Southern France, which closely followed the older church’s original construction, except for a portico which was added on in 1963
                        Now this church has become a visitor attraction in recognizing historical places in Melaka.
